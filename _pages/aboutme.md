I am a man of strong likes and dislikes. From daily routine to files on my workstation, I like to be very organized(not everyday though).

Currently I am enrolled in PhD in Electronics and Communication engineering at NIT Jalandhar. 

Most of my daytime is devoted to PhD work, evening time to jogging.
