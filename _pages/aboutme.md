Hmm..
If carefully provoked, I can talk on any topic for any length, be it the time jitter control in data acquisition devices to the journey of Po in becoming kung-fu panda
I am a man of strong likes and dislikes. From daily routine to files on my workstation, I like to be very organized(not everyday though).

Currently I am enrolled in PhD in Electronics and Communication engineering at NIT Jalandhar. 

Most of my daytime is devoted to PhD work, evening time to jogging.
