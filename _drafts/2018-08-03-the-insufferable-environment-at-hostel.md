In Punjab state, the weather ranges from *scorching summers* to *shivery winters*. However the nature loves to measure the weather tolerance of a people in between summers and rainy season (Here we have 5 seasons in a year, diversity at its best).
I resides in campus hostel, and students are not allowed to have coolers in the room. Its OK for me, since I am comfortable without cooler/AC and sometimes even ceiling fan.
