In Punjab state, the weather ranges from *scorching summers* to *shivery winters*. During the rainy season, if it not rains then it is very humid. 
The high amount of humidity in the air will decrease the rate of perspiration (or evaporaton of sweat from the skin). This will create a very uncomfortable situation because body needs to cool-off via perspiration.
The body's thermoregulation (temperature regulation) mechanism is can be simplified as follows -
1. Activity inside the body creates heat
2. Brain senses the increase in internal temperature
3. 
However the nature loves to measure the weather tolerance of a people in between summers and rainy season (Here we have 5 seasons in a year, diversity at its best).
I resides in campus hostel, and students are not allowed to have coolers in the room. Its OK for me, since I am comfortable without cooler/AC and sometimes even ceiling fan.
